_Keywords: causal broadcast, large and dynamic systems_

Beamer slides of the presentation made during
[SRDS'18](http://www.lasid.ufba.br/srds2018). It's about removing the need of
piggybacking control information inside broadcast messages while ensuring causal
order even in systems subject to dynamic membership changes (e.g. leaving,
joining, crashing, self-reconfiguring processes). The paper is
[available](https://github.com/parchemins/paper-pcbroadcast-tex).
